Certainly! Here's a sample README.md file for the snakeAI repository:

# SnakeAI

SnakeAI is a Python project that allows an AI agent to play the classic game of Snake. The project uses a neural network model to make decisions for the snake, allowing it to navigate the game board and collect food without crashing into walls or its own tail.

## Installation

To use SnakeAI, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You'll also need to install the Pygame library, which can be done using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

You will also need PyTorch and its libraries :

```
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
```

Once you have Python and Pygame installed, you can clone the SnakeAI repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Zciwolvo/snakeAI.git
```

## Usage

To run the SnakeAI game, navigate to the project directory and run the `snake.py` file:

```
cd snakeAI
python snake.py
```

The game will start automatically, and the AI agent will begin playing. You can watch the game progress on the screen, and you can use the arrow keys to control the speed of the game.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game or the AI agent, you can modify the code in the `snake.py` file. The neural network model is defined in the `snakeAI.py` file, and you can adjust the parameters of the model to change the behavior of the AI agent.
